# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive Real-Time E-commerce Order Processing System using Spring Boot and Apache Kafka. The system will demonstrate advanced Kafka patterns including event sourcing, SAGA pattern for distributed transactions, real-time analytics, and microservices communication. The project will be containerized with Docker and include monitoring dashboards, making it an impressive showcase of modern distributed systems architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to place orders through a REST API, so that I can purchase products and trigger the order processing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order is placed THEN the system SHALL publish an "OrderCreated" event to Kafka
2. WHEN order data is invalid THEN the system SHALL return validation errors without publishing events
3. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL include order ID, customer details, items, and timestamp
4. WHEN the order service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want inventory to be automatically checked and reserved, so that overselling is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an "OrderCreated" event is received THEN the inventory service SHALL check product availability
2. WHEN inventory is sufficient THEN the system SHALL publish an "InventoryReserved" event
3. WHEN inventory is insufficient THEN the system SHALL publish an "InventoryInsufficient" event
4. WHEN inventory operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want payments to be processed automatically, so that orders can be fulfilled efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an "InventoryReserved" event is received THEN the payment service SHALL process the payment
2. WHEN payment succeeds THEN the system SHALL publish a "PaymentProcessed" event
3. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL publish a "PaymentFailed" event and release inventory
4. WHEN payment processing times out THEN the system SHALL handle the timeout gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to receive order confirmations and shipping notifications, so that I stay informed about my order status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a "PaymentProcessed" event is received THEN the notification service SHALL send order confirmation
2. WHEN an order is shipped THEN the system SHALL send shipping notification with tracking details
3. WHEN order processing fails THEN the system SHALL send appropriate failure notifications
4. WHEN notifications fail THEN the system SHALL retry with dead letter queue handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want real-time analytics and monitoring dashboards, so that I can track business metrics and system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any order event occurs THEN the system SHALL update real-time analytics streams
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display current order volumes, success rates, and processing times
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and update error metrics
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide detailed monitoring information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire system to be containerized with Docker, so that it can be easily deployed and scaled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN all services SHALL run in Docker containers
2. WHEN Docker Compose is executed THEN the system SHALL start Kafka, Zookeeper, databases, and all microservices
3. WHEN containers are scaled THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and message ordering
4. WHEN the system starts THEN health checks SHALL verify all components are running correctly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to implement the SAGA pattern for distributed transactions, so that data consistency is maintained across services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any step in the order process fails THEN the system SHALL execute compensating transactions
2. WHEN inventory reservation fails THEN the system SHALL not process payment
3. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL release reserved inventory automatically
4. WHEN the SAGA completes THEN the system SHALL ensure all services are in a consistent state

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and observability, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the distributed system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service processes events THEN the system SHALL provide distributed tracing across all services
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log structured error information with correlation IDs
3. WHEN messages cannot be processed THEN the system SHALL route them to dead letter queues
4. WHEN the system runs THEN metrics SHALL be exposed for monitoring tools like Prometheus
